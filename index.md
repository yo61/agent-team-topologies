# Agent Team Topologies

**A quick-reference model for structuring multi-agent teams in Claude Code.**
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

8 composable topology patterns — a nod to [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) thinking, applied to how work flows through agent teams. Browse the patterns, find what fits, and adapt.

## Pick Your Topology

| Goal | Question | Topology |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Understand** | Multiple independent questions? | [Parallel Explorers](topologies/parallel-explorers/) |
| | Ambiguous bug? | [Competing Hypotheses](topologies/competing-hypotheses/) |
| **Build** | Multi-layer feature? | [Feature Pod](topologies/feature-pod/) |
| | Many small tasks? | [Task Queue](topologies/task-queue/) |
| | Pure coordination? | [Orchestrator-Only](topologies/orchestrator-only/) |
| **Review** | Multiple lenses? | [Review Board](topologies/review-board/) |
| **Risky change** | Expensive to get wrong? | [Risky Refactor](topologies/risky-refactor/) |
| **Any of the above** | Need quality enforcement? | + [Quality-Gated](topologies/quality-gated/) overlay |

## The 8 Topologies

| Pattern | Best For | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| [Parallel Explorers](topologies/parallel-explorers/) | Discovery, research, codebase mapping | Low |
| [Review Board](topologies/review-board/) | Code review with distinct lenses | Low |
| [Competing Hypotheses](topologies/competing-hypotheses/) | Ambiguous bugs, architectural decisions | Medium |
| [Feature Pod](topologies/feature-pod/) | Cross-layer feature delivery | Medium |
| [Risky Refactor](topologies/risky-refactor/) | High-risk changes needing plan approval | Low |
| [Orchestrator-Only](topologies/orchestrator-only/) | Pure coordination, lead never codes | High |
| [Quality-Gated](topologies/quality-gated/) | Enforcing completion standards (composable) | Overlay |
| [Task Queue](topologies/task-queue/) | Many small independent tasks | High |

{: .important }
> **Topologies are primitives, not monoliths.** Any teammate slot can itself become a topology -- a reviewer in Feature Pod can spawn a Review Board, an explorer can fan out sub-explorers. See [Composing Topologies](docs/composing-topologies.md) for recipes.
