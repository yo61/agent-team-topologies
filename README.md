# Agent Team Topologies

**A quick-reference model for structuring multi-agent teams in Claude Code.**

> 8 composable topology patterns — a nod to [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) thinking, applied to how work flows through agent teams. Browse the patterns, find what fits, and adapt.

> [!WARNING]
> **Agent teams are experimental.** They're disabled by default in Claude Code. Enable them by setting `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` to `1` in your settings or environment. See the [official agent teams documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/agent-teams) for setup and known limitations.

## Quick Start

Install as a Claude Code plugin from the [yo61-skills marketplace](https://github.com/yo61/claude-skills):

```
/plugin marketplace add yo61/claude-skills
/plugin install agent-team-topologies
```

Then invoke the topology chooser with `/agent-team-topologies:topology`.

You get:
- **6 subagents** — explorer, security-reviewer, perf-reviewer, test-reviewer, architect, implementer
- **`topology` skill** — interactive chooser that recommends a topology based on your goal
- **Hook script templates** — quality gates and idle summary enforcement (see [`.claude/hooks/README.md`](.claude/hooks/README.md))

Prefer a manual install? Clone this repo and copy `agents/`, `skills/`, and `.claude/hooks/` into your project's `.claude/` directory.

## The 8 Topologies

| Pattern | Best For | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| [Parallel Explorers](topologies/parallel-explorers/) | Discovery, research, codebase mapping | Low |
| [Review Board](topologies/review-board/) | Code review with distinct lenses | Low |
| [Competing Hypotheses](topologies/competing-hypotheses/) | Ambiguous bugs, architectural decisions | Medium |
| [Feature Pod](topologies/feature-pod/) | Cross-layer feature delivery | Medium |
| [Risky Refactor](topologies/risky-refactor/) | High-risk changes needing plan approval | Low |
| [Orchestrator-Only](topologies/orchestrator-only/) | Pure coordination, lead never codes | High |
| [Quality-Gated](topologies/quality-gated/) | Enforcing completion standards (composable) | Overlay |
| [Task Queue](topologies/task-queue/) | Many small independent tasks | High |

Topologies are primitives, not monoliths — any teammate slot can itself become a topology. See the [Composing Topologies](https://eirwin.github.io/agent-team-topologies/docs/composing-topologies.html) guide for recipes.
